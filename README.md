Task 2: Linked List Implementation – Detailed Description
As part of my data structures learning and coding practice, I worked on implementing a Linked List in the C programming language. This task focused on understanding dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and node manipulation — all of which are crucial for efficient memory handling and runtime data structure management.

What I Did
In this task, I created a singly linked list from scratch. The main operations I implemented included:
Node creation
Insertion at beginning, end, and at a specific position
Deletion of nodes from different positions
Searching an element
Displaying the entire list

I defined a structure (struct Node) that contained two parts: an integer data and a pointer to the next node (next). I then created functions to manage the list using dynamic memory (malloc() and free()), ensuring memory was allocated and released appropriately.

To manage edge cases like inserting in an empty list, deleting from an invalid position, or searching for nonexistent elements, I added error checks and clear message prompts. I also used loops and pointer manipulations extensively to traverse and modify the list dynamically during runtime.

The final program was menu-driven, allowing users to select from a set of operations and interact with the linked list. This helped improve modularity and made testing easier.

Tools and Platforms Used
To successfully complete this task, I relied on a variety of tools, resources, and platforms:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): I used this as my primary editor due to its lightweight design, real-time error highlighting, and integrated terminal for compiling and running the C program.
Google Search: I frequently consulted Google to understand linked list theory, syntax-related issues, and various use cases. It also helped clarify pointer behavior during insertion and deletion.
YouTube: Watching videos on linked lists gave me a better visual understanding of node connections and traversal. It made complex pointer operations easier to grasp. ChatGPT: I used ChatGPT to review my logic, resolve bugs, and get quick explanations for tricky concepts. It also helped generate template code snippets that I could modify and expand upon.
These resources allowed me to grasp both theoretical and practical aspects of linked list implementation more effectively.

Programming Preferences
I preferred C language for this task because of its close interaction with memory and pointers, which are essential for understanding data structures. I avoided using libraries or predefined data types, so I could learn how memory is allocated and deallocated manually.
I chose a command-line interface (CLI) based environment to reinforce my understanding of how data structures operate at a system level. This practice is important for roles in system programming and embedded development.

Applicability of the Task
The linked list is one of the fundamental data structures in computer science and is widely applicable in real-world scenarios:
Memory-efficient storage: Especially when the number of elements isn't known in advance or changes frequently.
Dynamic data structures: Used in stacks, queues, and graphs.
Real-time systems: Where insertion and deletion operations need to be fast and flexible.
Operating system kernels: For managing tasks, resources, or memory blocks.
Custom memory allocators: Like those used in embedded systems.

This task deepened my understanding of how data structures work under the hood and laid a strong foundation for learning advanced structures like doubly linked lists, trees, and graphs. It also prepared me for technical interviews and coding challenges, where linked list problems are very common.
